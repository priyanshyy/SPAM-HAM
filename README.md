### SPAM-HAM
# Introduction
Spam detection is a crucial task in email filtering to ensure that users do not receive unwanted messages. This project explores different machine learning algorithms to classify emails as spam or ham. We have used several models and compared their performance based on accuracy.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains labeled email data, where each email is marked as spam or ham. The dataset was preprocessed to remove noise and irrelevant information.

# Models Used
We have implemented and compared the following machine learning models:

Logistic Regression

Naive Bayes

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Decision Tree

Random Forest

Gradient Boosting

# Best Model
The best-performing model was Logistic Regression.
